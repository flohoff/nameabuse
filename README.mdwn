The goal for these tools is to find "name tag abuse" in OSM Data. You will need libosmium to run
the "nameabuse" program which outputs objects with the name and a selected list of tags.

Then a perl script with Naive Bayes needs to be run on that data to classify the objects.

	./nameabuse -i osm.pdf >tobeclassified
	./classify tobeclassified


`classify` will read `train-good` and `train-fail` and then classify all rows in named file and output
them to `classify-fail` and `classify-good`.
